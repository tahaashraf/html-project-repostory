<h2>And World Health Organization said that:-</h2>
<br>
<h3>Fact1:</h3>
<p>You can recover from illness caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19). Being infected with the new corona virus does not mean that you will be infected with the virus forever. Most people who get COVID-19 recover completely and get rid of the virus from their bodies. If you do get sick, be sure to treat your symptoms. If you have a cough, fever and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention early, but phone the health care facility first. Most patients recover with supportive care</p>
<br>
<h3>fact2:</h3>
<p>5G wireless networks do not spread COVID-19 infection Viruses cannot travel over radio waves or mobile phone networks. COVID-19 is spreading in many countries that do not even have 5G networks. COVID-19 is spread by respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. The infection is transmitted to people if they touch a contaminated surface and then touch their eyes, mouth or nose.</p>

<h3>fact3:</h3>
<p>The COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas where the climate is hot and humid From the evidence available so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in all areas, including areas with hot and humid weather. Whatever the climate, take precautions if you live in or intend to travel to an area where COVID-19 infection has been reported. Perhaps the best way to protect yourself from contracting COVID-19 is to wash your hands regularly. By doing this, you can get rid of viruses that may be stuck on your hands and thus avoid possible infection if you touch your eyes, mouth or nose.</p>
